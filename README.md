=================

This is the website built for the 2012 Election of [SASSE](www.sasse.se). It's built using the static website generator [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/) and hosted on [election.sasse.se](http://election.sasse.se). The code and (public) content is hosted on SASSE's github account, [github.com/hhss/election.sasse.se](http://election.sasse.se/hhss/election.sasse.se)

Designed, produced and served by The IT Commitee 2011/2012 in cooperation with the Election Committee 2012.


Candidates
----------

All candidates for the SASSE board are entitled to a personal page to present themselves. In absence of any special requests, their election porks will be published. Candidates who wish to customize their page may submit a pull request or e-mail [webmaster@sasse.se](mailto:webmaster@sasse.se). You may, for example, request a link to your campaign Facebook page.

All board candidacies are listed on a common page, sorted committee/position wise. When there is more than one candidate for one position, the list of candidates for that position is randomized on each page visit.

FUM candidates will be listed on a common page together with their election porks. The list is randomized on each visit to minimize the risk of one candidate getting less exposure than others.

Other candidacies are listed on a common page in a similar manner to FUM.
