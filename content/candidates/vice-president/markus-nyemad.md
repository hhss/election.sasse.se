## Three reasons to vote for you:

* I dislike the Eurovision Song Contest,

## Can you explain the impact, if any, that social networking and web 2.0 has made on you personally?
It has improved my ability to express myself in written communication through some painful consequences of misinterpreted irony. Also, it has taught me to tie a bow tie. So, a huge impact.

* If you elect me Vice President I will strive to increase the cooperation with and openness towards the student associations at other schools. The possibility to combine the strong entrepreneurial drive at SSE with the expertise of other areas of study is in my opinion one to cherish!

* Furthermore, I want to continue in the foot-steps of my predecessors and work to make sure that experience and know-how from different projects are retained in order to avoid repeating past mistakes and to avoid project child deceases.

* To ensure this I will strive towards improved means of feedback, evaluation and knowledge transfer. I will assist to increase communication between past project members and new ones to make life easier for everyone.

* I think it is very important that everyone can find something that attracts him or her within the Student Association. Therefore I want to encourage and facilitate wider participation by Retail Management, MSc, PhD and MBA students in all projects and activities. The possible contributions from all these people not involved would benefit our association immensely.

* I will do my utmost to make sure that the Student Association premises maintain the highest of sanitary levels. Taking care of all the practical issues in an efficient manner as soon as they appear is important to ensure a pleasant and safe experience for everyone entering our premises.

* I will also work to increase the knowledge of how the Student Association is organised and operates. No question will be too big or too small and my door shall always be open for anyone. After several years working in the public sector I am used to discussing business over a cup of black coffee!

* SÅ, vote for Nyemad as VP! It gives you wings!
