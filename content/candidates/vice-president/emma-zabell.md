## What would you give to the Hecklers in order to make them behave nicely?
Page 5 in the Attention: Events Guide Week 40

## Three reasons to vote for you:
I always have a positive spirit. I am persistent. Dedicated to the things I do.

## Three reasons not to vote for you:
You want me to be a janitor. I think I can sing great, but I can’t. I like surströmming.

##Can you explain the impact, if any, that social networking and web 2.0 has made on you personally?
I really like the fact that you can network with anyone at any time in any part of the world. But it takes
quite some time to always be updated, and I am considering giving myself time restrictions on my
Facebook account to remind myself of the world beyond the Internet.

During my first year at SSE I have had a leading role within SASSE at CFR as the Social Officer. This has given me the opportunity to learn a lot about the daily workflow within the Student Association. I have helped students to arrange everything from small events to big banquets like SNS. I have also participated in the Student Council and have had contact with the faculty. This has given me an understanding of the SASSE as a whole and my interest of improving our Student Association has only grown bigger.

As your Vice President I will make sure that the student’s interests are met and that we will continue to develop, both as an association and as individuals by sharing our experiences. During the last few years the position of the Vice President has been associated with the role of the janitor. This is something that I want to change, by putting my biggest effort into the persons in the SASSE rather than the premises. In my daily work I will contribute with a positive spirit and do my best to encourage the students within the SASSE.

During my year as your Vice President I will focus on the internal education and communication in order to improve the effectiveness of SASSE. I want to make it easier for the students both to start up projects and to know who to contact in the various committees. I will make sure that the project manager’s forum will be held more often. To have the opportunity to share and learn about experiences from different kinds of projects we will build a stronger association. In order to improve the communication I want to develop clear guidelines about who to contact no matter what type of questions you have.
