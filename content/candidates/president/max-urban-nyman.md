## If SASSE got 10.000.000 SEK that were to be spent in four days, what would you do?
First I’d of course throw a massive party to celebrate the occasion, then I would consult the student body in order to ascertain what need(s) could be best addressed with the money (e.g. more study space)

1.  **Increased Integration with the Masters Students, Norrtälje**

    We all bring different experiences and skill sets to the table. To build the best possible Student Association we must leverage all of these skill sets. For example the Student Association could benefit from better utilizing Norrtälje’s deep company connections as well as by leveraging the expertise and diverse backgrounds of the Masters students.

2.  **Lunch Promotions at Various Restaurants**

    Increasing lunch prices at Babel, microwaved meals and 12kr for a cup of coffee has annoyed many of us. If elected President I promise to build partnerships with businesses in the area to get better lunch promotions.

3.  **Better Communication with Student Services**

    With the importance of attending spring weeks, securing internships, getting A’s, etc. many of can fall prey to the so-called “Handelshets”.  By increasing the relationship with Student Services we can make them more available for us, the students, and our needs. They are here for us so let´s get to know them!

4.  **Make the Student Association More Accessible to the Students at SSE**

    If elected president I hope to build upon and further develop the efforts of previous administrations in making the Student Association more accessible by for example distributing Att-Bladet via email, sponsoring more mingles, and by holding more open houses beyond the introduction weeks. By doing so, we could spread the energy and sense of community the Student Association brings.
