## What would you give to the Hecklers in order to make them behave nicely?
A trip to the archipelago, a Thermos of coffee and a good book to read

## Three reasons to vote for you:

* Genuine interest and passion for SASSE
* An experienced leader
* A rational visionary

## Three reasons not to vote for you:

* You do not like my yellow Thermos
* You don´t believe in SASSE
* You do not like people who are optimistic about time

## If SASSE got 10 000 000 SEK that were to be spent in four days, what would you do?
Together with my Vice President buy: a BIG ventilation system for the Rotunda, new toilet facilities, remake the pub into an actual pub and build a new house at Enoksro.

Through leadership, experiences and commitment to SASSE, I will lead the Board openly and effectively, making way for change. It all boils down to one question.
What can SASSE do for you?

**Include and involve!** A bigger SASSE is a stronger SASSE. Working on the integration of the Masters and CFR will be one of the biggest challenges. I promise to work to integrate the Master Students and CFR from a strategic long-term perspective in collaboration with SSE. The added opportunities would strengthen our organization to the benefit of all SSE students.

**Create innovative culture!** SASSE is at its best when everyone gets the opportunity to do what they want, sharing their interests with other students. I want to channelize the entrepreneurial spirits into starting new projects by encouraging and supporting them. Representation towards other student associations, will open up new opportunities.

**Advocate the students!** The interests of the students must be strongly advocated towards the school. In close cooperation with the President of the Education Committee, I will make sure educational quality is kept high. In relations to media, my responsibility as President is to convey an accurate image of SASSE. I want to create a PR strategy that is proactive, not only reactive.

**Visible leadership!** Through SASSE I have experiences from Get Out, DJ Society, The Social Committee Board, Friedmans, Handelsspexet, The Student Council, Minimax and more. Additionally, I have leadership experiences from running my own sailing school, being a scout leader and from my military service, representing 8000 soldiers towards the Parliament, the Military Headquarters and Media during my time in Värnpliktsrådet.

*300 words is not enough to convey all the things I will do as SASSE President, to get the full picture visit facebook.com/nextSASSEpresident, or just give me a call.*

Yours sincerely,
