## Three reasons to vote for you:

1. I have a clear vision and a plan to take us there
2. I am a candidate with relevant experience.
3. I approach life and its challenges with a smile.

## Three reasons not to vote for you:

1. My vision and plan does not attract you
2. I have not managed a SASSE project
3. During long or inefficient meetings, I might introduce … efficiency

## If SASSE got 10 000 000 SEK that were to be spent in four days, what would you do?

* Air-con to the pub and rotunda
* Touch up the Aula to KAW standards (i.e. leg room, foldable writing tables)
* Completion of the library
* A renovation of the Pub to make it an attractive area day-time  too
* Elementary courses in rethoric and language to all lecturing professors.

SASSE is facing some serious challenges and we need to create awareness of the issues and construct a plan on how to deal with them.

I have identified three main challenges:

1. Projects get handed over every year, sometimes lacking structures to provide sufficient continuity. With clear structures in place, project managers could focus more on being creative and developing the projects.

2. We have major difficulties in integrating students from the Retail-Management program and the Masters program in to SASSE. We need to represent all members of SASSE – that will benefit all of us.

3. According to research, 12 % of the students at SSE show signs of depression. SASSE is good at making students have fun: I want us to become great at making students feel good as well.

In order to tackle these issues, I believe that we need to employ a longer-term perspective. It is my impression that our long-term goals are lost somewhere between the SASSE Board and the committees. SASSE lacks a structure that enables the organization to pursue its long-term goals in an efficient way.

I have a clear vision of the direction in which SASSE needs to develop and a plan on how to take us there. I have experience that will serve me well as SASSE president, dealing with the aforementioned issues. My experiences are primarily acquired outside of SSE – as an entrepreneur, as a project manager for an online newspaper, as a board member of UF (JA-YE) and as a founder of a student association, which grows every year. I believe my perspectives would contribute to a diversified skill set of the Board.

I hope I have convinced you to support my quest to help SASSE to realize its full potential!
