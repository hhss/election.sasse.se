## What would you give to the Hecklers in order to make them behave nicely?
They won’t be nice but maybe a Zumba class would get them loosened up!

## Three reasons to vote for you:
I am a doer, I am positive and engaging and I am a reliable supporter in all occasions.

## Three reasons not to vote for you:
I am blonde, I did not graduate high school with 20,0 & my smile ain’t as big as Hoffman’s

## If SASSE got 10 000 000 SEK that were to be spent in four days, what would you do?
I would renovate our facilities that are in desperate need, like Enoksro and other SASSE premises. Also, I would outsource some of the necessary IT-solutions and accounting.

I think that SASSE is outstanding in all of its main focus areas; social activities, business relations and education. However, the latter one is an area in which I believe we can do more. As president of SASSE, I will work closely together with the Education Committee, SSE faculty and the student body to improve our education. I want students at SSE to have good study facilities, engaging seminar teachers, wisely planned exam periods and a president of SASSE who’s ready to stand up for the students’ opinions.

I also believe that it is important to have a greater diversity among the students. This will not only improve our university ranking, but also benefit our social environment. I am eager to communicate that SSE is open to all students by further developing our ambassador programs and displaying our wide range of SASSE projects.

Regarding the internal and external communications within SASSE, there are many areas of improvement. Given the fact that SASSE is a one-year organization we need to be more transparent and better structured in order to avoid making the same mistakes twice. Also, having a new president of SSE gives us an opportunity to improve our cooperation with SSE.

Last but not least, we need to improve our work of including Master- and Norrtälje students in SASSE and dare to let go of old projects to create space for new initiatives.

With experiences in several different projects including Entrepreneurship Society, SASSE Dance and Cheerleading, Project Moral Investment and the Female Economist of The Year scholarship, I consider myself having a good insight of both SSE and SASSE. With a true passion for SASSE and a profound love of motivating people around me, I will commit 100% as SASSE president.

I would be very honored to represent SASSE 2013/2014.
