International relations are important and many of our students envision themselves working abroad at one point or another during their life, and we need to provide the inspiration that comes with that perspective.

As President of the International Committee I would work tirelessly to increase the student body’s exposure to the possibilities of working and studying abroad. I would like to increase the amount of company lectures aimed towards this as well as examine the possibilities to have an IntU-fair more specifically aimed towards this goal. I would also encourage the regional associations to increase their activities, both business and entertainment oriented.

We live in a global world, and the only thing we can do is to prepare ourselves.

I believe SASSE is here to serve all the students of our school, and I believe that there are many things that realistically could be improved. Student health is central, and we must work with the faculty in any way we can to enable students to perform to their full potential. The integration between Sveavägen and Norrtälje has come a long way, but there is still much to do. We are but one school. As a member of the board I belive I could help with a lot of the work that needs to be done.

The reasons why I am particularly qualified are that I have great international experience – working as a military diplomat in Moscow for two years –, drive, compassion and a tendency to get things done. I don’t expect to be able to move the world in just one year, but I DO hope to bring some fresh ideas and culture of resistance to automatic nay-saying (yes, that is a Jobber-reference…) to the student body’s arena of international activities.

And also:

Drink some tea. It helps.
