## What would you give to the Hecklers in order to make them behave nicely?

I have nothing to offer other than blood, toil, tears, and sweat. Mostly sweat.

## Three reasons to vote for you:

* I have served my country as an officer and a gentleman in both military and diplomatic capacities for nigh four years.
* I have personally violated the sovereignty of two foreign nations.
* I respect the Power of the Tea.

## Three reasons not to vote for you:

* You prefer an International Committee of lesser stature and clout
* Empire Strikes Back is your least favorite in the trilogy because "it was the most boringest one"
* You’d enjoy some peace and quiet.

## If you were to be a flag, which one would you be?

The flag raised on Mount Suribachi at the outset of the Battle of Iwo Jima. It stands for everything I believe in: the virtues of industrialization, the importance of disciplined teamwork, and the fearsome potential of combined arms operations. The statue commissioned to commemorate its raising graces the environs of the Pentagon, Virginia, which I correctly predicted would swing Democrat in the 2012 elections.

International relations are important and many of our students envision themselves working abroad at one point or another during their life, and we need to provide the inspiration that comes with that perspective.

As President of the International Committee I would work tirelessly to increase the student body’s exposure to the possibilities of working and studying abroad. I would like to increase the amount of company lectures aimed towards this as well as examine the possibilities to have an IntU-fair more specifically aimed towards this goal. I would also encourage the regional associations to increase their activities, both business and entertainment oriented.

We live in a global world, and the only thing we can do is to prepare ourselves.

I believe SASSE is here to serve all the students of our school, and I believe that there are many things that realistically could be improved. Student health is central, and we must work with the faculty in any way we can to enable students to perform to their full potential. The integration between Sveavägen and Norrtälje has come a long way, but there is still much to do. We are but one school. As a member of the board I belive I could help with a lot of the work that needs to be done.

The reasons why I am particularly qualified are that I have great international experience – working as a military diplomat in Moscow for two years –, drive, compassion and a tendency to get things done. I don’t expect to be able to move the world in just one year, but I DO hope to bring some fresh ideas and culture of resistance to automatic nay-saying (yes, that is a Jobber-reference…) to the student body’s arena of international activities.

And also:

Drink some tea. It helps.
