What is great about Intu, which I would like to keep, is that it has two faces, one serious and one more relaxed. Students can choose what they want to be engaged in and to what degree.

I want Intu to be the committee that empowers individuals and utilizes the incredible drive that exists at this school. Offering a chance to meet new people from different years and cultures, and having a lot of fun together, is what makes this committee so exiting.

Campaign promises:

1.  Unify Intu

    As of today, the communication and interaction between projects and regional associations is lacking and can be improved tremendously. I want members of Intu to feel that they are a part of one big family that takes care of and motivates each other.We are one, and we are great!

2.  Increased business approach

    A larger focus towards development that explores new areas within Intu. Besides the international projects, the regional associations should have the opportunity to offer lectures concerning international matters. An example: the lunch lecture the American Association held before the US election.

3.  Increase marketing and benefit to all students

    There are many interesting and fantastic events needed to be highlighted so that students know exactly when different projects are taking place and why they can’t miss them. Further, the international projects need to reach a broader audience so more students can benefit from all the hard work put in to the projects.

Why me?

I will make things happen. I am driven, structured and care about details. I have international experience, lived abroad for 5 years, and I will listen. Together we will make this the most exiting committee of them all.
