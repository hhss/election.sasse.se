During my college year in USA I was on the tennis team with players coming from 7 countries. This experience made me realize how enriching it is to meet people from different cultures and how it provides new perspectives. I believe the International Committee is an optimal platform for this kind of exchange.

My true interest for the International Committee began when I joined one of the regional associations; the fantastic Der Verein. Eventually I was privileged to become a board member of the International Committee, which has given me valuable insights and the responsibility for arranging events such as the sensational Battle of Europe.

What makes the International Committee unique is the wide range of activities that it offers; anything from joining a tapas dinner with El Club to going to Brazil with a CSR purpose. As a president I would work to enable students to develop valuable skills by engaging in projects. I would especially strive to enhance the current involvement in the regional associations by encouraging existing as well as new initiatives.

The International Committee should be an open-door committee. Anyone who wishes to take part should easily be able to do so. Whether you want to socialize, fully engage in projects or contribute with opinions and ideas, I would see it as my responsibility to make this achievable for every student.  Furthermore, I would strongly aim to integrate and reach students from all categories; bachelor, master and exchange.

Given my experience, dedication and eagerness to learn, I feel more than ready to take on the responsibility that comes with the role as president and a member of the SASSE board. I would feel honored to be entrusted with the important and exciting mission of further developing the full potential of the International Committee.
