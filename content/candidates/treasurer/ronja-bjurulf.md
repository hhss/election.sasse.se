We all had different reasons for applying to SSE. Maybe yours was an interest in economics or a belief that SSE would open doors in the future. Mine was that I had found an interest in accounting while working as the financial accountant for a company in Karlstad, with a turnover similar to that of SASSE. I applied to SSE because I wanted to learn more about accounting, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I have made.

However, it didnâ€™t take long for me to realize that SSE, and especially SASSE, offered so much more than just a future in accounting. I joined the M2 Project group as co-responsible for the magazine and I also became Head of Sponsorship in Project Enoksro. These projects have given me insight into SASSE and the opportunities it offers to the students at SSE. I want to contribute to maintain SASSE as a source of learning and great experiences, as well as a place for finding new friends, which it has been to me. By doing something I am passionate about, accounting, I want to create the possibility for you to focus on what you are passionate about.

The previous Treasurers have done a great job. Most recently the opportunity to pay by credit card has been an appreciated improvement. As Treasurer, I would strive towards expanding this possibility. Imagine being able to pay with your card when buying tickets to banquets.

Vote for me as Treasurer and you will get a person passionate about numbers and experienced in the field of accounting. Vote for me as Treasurer if you prefer having the choice between cash and card payment. Vote for me as Treasurer if you want to be able to focus on what you are passionate about!
