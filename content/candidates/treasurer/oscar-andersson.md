What goes around comes around! Vote for me to come around I’ll make sure SASSE goes around!

When I started at SSE over a year ago, I thought I would keep the same distinction between school  and spare time that I always had. I didn’t realize what an impact the student association would have on me. But as I got to be a part of it, from the first day and forward, I came to love SASSE. An  organization that combines career services and international projects with entertainment and  partying, all for the benefit of us students, is an amazing enterprise. This genuine passion for SASSE will mark my tenure as treasurer and I will do my uttermost to maintain a well-functioning accountancy so that the student association can continue to thrive.

During the last five years, there have been a lot of accounting-related changes in SASSE. Much has  been done to shape up the accountancy and now auditors can actually recognize that we are a student association at a business school. We now need to take a step back and evaluate the processes we have established. As present treasurer of the Business Committee, I am accustomed to accounting in the student association.  I have observed what is working well but also what could be streamlined further. I believe I’m the right guy to steer the accountancy in the right direction.

I always take a positive view on issues and try to make the best of the situation. My door at the treasury would always be open and I would be glad to help out in any way that would serve you as a student.

Finally, I’m a guy that enjoys life. Vote for me and I think that we all would have great fun together!
