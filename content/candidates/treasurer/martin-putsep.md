Who is the Treasurer?

Not only is the Treasurer strategic responsible for the economy and everyday economic transactions, but also for having a greater perspective on everything that happens in the Student Association

It is an important and challenging job with a lot of depth and responsibility, a job that I would feel be happy to take on.

Many of you might wonder what it is that I actually have done for the Student Association so far. And I am the first to admit that it has not been a great deal.

But after Småttingkommittén (fu**ing awesome!!) I really found SASSE, and I would like to make it an even bigger part of my life.

I would like to contribute to SASSE, and I believe that I can best do so in the role of Treasurer.

With a big interest in accounting, hard work ethics and an eagerness to learn more, I am sure that I would be a great Treasurer.

Over the years the economy of the Student Association has gone from catastrophic to actually being up to date. I would love the opportunity to continue this trend and make the economy even better.

If elected as Treasurer I would improve the routines giving me more time to focus on the important workload.

I would also make it a priority that students are being reimbursed for expenses they have made in connection to projects more quickly.

I would also take the final step and fully implement the use of cardmachines.

It would be an honor if you elected me as the Treasurer of the Student Association, and I can assure you that both of us would have a year to look forward to.
