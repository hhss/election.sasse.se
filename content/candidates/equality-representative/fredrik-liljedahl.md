I believe that people are equal in value no matter gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or religious beliefs (to name a few). Great work has been done to improve the equality at SSE, but we still have much more to do. I would be honored to represent you in these issues towards the faculty, the Student Association, fellow students and society at large.
