I think the Sports Committee/IDU is fantastic! It gathers students from all different ages, countries and backgrounds to meet and participate in their common interest: SPORTS.
I would really want the opportunity to continue making this committee even better!

I have played different sports all my life, especially badminton and football. I think one of the most important things, if elected president of the sports committee, will be not to pursue the sports that interest me or the committee most, but to listen to all you students of the SSE and act in accordance with your interests. I want to increase the opportunities for any student to suggest new sports and activities.

In my year as a member of the Sports Committee Board, I have had lots of great experiences and learnt how this amazing committee works. I have learnt to understand what parts that work well and where there is room for improvement. I will continue the improvement of the IDU-room as a meeting and study place which is open for everyone. In addition, I believe that the IDU-room could be a place for students to meet and watch sport events and matches together. More students, also those not playing in any of the teams, should be able to enjoy more IDU-events.

The various sports are very well organized internally. But I think that there would also be benefits from increasing the interaction between the different teams. One idea is the introduction of an annual
“IDU-awards” - a big award ceremony to celebrate sports, with prizes given to individuals and teams that have contributed extra to sports at SSE.  This would be an opportunity to meet and have fun with students from other teams and also students that do not (yet) practice sports within SASSE.
