From day one I loved everything SASSE is about, strong fellowship among students, endless fun and plenty of creativity. The Sports Committee is the very heart and soul of this - an easy and relaxed way for people to gather. It would be a great honor and a lot fun to be able to be the leader of such a great Committee and developing it further.

As the President of The Sports Committee (SC) I would focus on the school spirit and getting more people involved in the Committee. To succeed with this I would invite all students, even the students who is not actively partaking in the SC, to join us on the annually tournaments as supporters. Going to Barcelona with SC was one of my best experiences at SSE and something I hope that everybody gets the chance to experience. These tournaments are a great opportunity for students to develop new friendships and strengthen the bond between the different years of enrollment and programs, which is what SASSE is all about.

Another thing I would like to do is to host a second open house at the SC. This would be a great opportunity for students to come down to the SC and under more relaxed terms get the feeling of it.  They would be able to tell their views and aspirations for the Committee, under a stress- free atmosphere.

With me the door will always be open and new initiatives encouraged.  Voting for me would be voting for someone who would put her heart and soul into the job as President of the Sports Committee 13/14.
