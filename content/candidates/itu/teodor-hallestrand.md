## What would you give to the Hecklers in order to make them behave nicely?
A message: Haters gonna hate.

## Three reasons to vote for you:

1. I will significantly change ITU for the better
2. There will be a SASSE dog mascot (maybe).
3. I will beat the hecklers in Age of Empires 1 vs 7.

## Three reasons not to vote for you:

1. Change can be scary, are you prepared?
2. Experience in ITU so far: arranging LANs.
3. Sadly, I too am a terrible rapper.

## If you were a website, which one would you be?
Your favorite one.

There is a great need for a new direction for ITU at SASSE.

* Why can’t we watch lectures and seminars online?
* Why are we not automatically logged on to SASSE.SE and PORTAL.HHS.SE on our mobile phones and computers and why isn’t there an APP that combines both websites?
* Why can’t we sign up for company presentations through an APP made by SASSE?
* Why do we have to buy unsellable collections of old exams and articles from a print center that refuses service after 16.01? (Make it available online!)
* How can we assure stability and continuity of the portal which is an integral part of the solution provided to recruiting companies which in turn provide us with almost ALL of our revenue?
* Why are the computers in the computer rooms on Saltmätargatan dog-slow when there are finance students who sometimes need to use them for +12h straight?

Someone needs to take responsibility for issues like those above and bring lasting improvement to the everyday life of the members of SASSE and that someone is me, Teodor. Even if ITUs responsibility does not include some of the issues above, there needs to be a competent entity pushing for change.

I have thought thoroughly on how to improve life for SASSE members and students at SSE. I sincerely believe that I can, with the help of the SASSE Board, can follow through and solve the issues at hand. Not only is technology my biggest interest, I also have the knowledge, experience, dedication and leadership experience to make a difference.

ITU needs to shed the heavy responsibility of maintaining the IT-infrastructure and get ready to outsource it all in order to focus resources on projects that truly would improve The Student Association.

## If you want change, then VOTE TEODOR for ITU-PRESIDENT!
