**Vision for 2013: Make ITU and the IT-platform of SASSE Reliable, Efficient and Inspiring**

## Campaign promises:

### 1 - Make reliability our top priority

I believe ITU’s most important function is to maintain a well-functioning IT-platform to make sure that all other committees can do their very best without interruption. Developing new features is important but too many people depend on the Email-client and Kårportalen for them to be offline even five minutes. We ought to keep enhancing the IT-platform but we must never do so at the expense of stability or reliability.

### 2 - Outsource smarter

I believe outsourcing must play a bigger part of the IT-Committee’s work going forward. By focusing more time on understanding the problems and outsourcing the actual fix we can address the urgent needs of today such as increasing reliability and reducing support time without increasing spending outrageously or losing control over what’s important.

### 3 - Inspire others to develop their own apps and websites

I believe we should share our knowledge and inspire others to develop their own apps and websites. Through interactive workshops and seminars for everyone interested we can share our knowledge and provide tools they need to turn their ideas into reality. By teaching others how to create their own IT-solutions we can use the full potential of perhaps the two of the greatest strengths of SASSE, the imagination and ingenuity of our members.

### Closing statement:

I have been active in SASSE and the IT-Committee since I started SSE and I strongly believe ITU needs an IT-President that has the experience to guide it forward. I’m campaigning for this position not for its prestige but for its challenges. As the current Vice-President and Project-Coordinator, I’m confident in my ability to turn my vision and promises for 2013 into reality.
