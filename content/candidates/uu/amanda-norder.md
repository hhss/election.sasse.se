The promise of my EduC (Education Committee) is simple: a **diverse** set of **engaged** students **standing up** for everybody’s interest to make sure we get the world-class education we deserve!

I was born and raised in the South of France by Swedish parents. I believe this double-nationality brings both open-mindedness and adaptability. Serving as Head of Events in EduC, has taught me the ropes and tricks of the committee, while being President of the Exchange Committee has been a great opportunity to practice representing a hundred students towards the school.
As a person, I’m triple-S (Serious, Structured, Strong focus), and very much triple-P (I love new People, Places and Parties).

I think EduC already does a great job. However, the promise of my EduC 2013/2014 is simple:

* **Engagement**: EduC 13/14 is by the students for the students. We’ll build a great team, making sure that everybody who cares about the education can participate. We offer you not only the chance to define the education you get, but also to shape a great committee.

* **Diversity**: SSE is a fantastic mix of great people with different backgrounds, focus of studies and dreams; which is a point I will stress even more. As a very concrete step, I’d work to further integrate international and Retail Management students into SASSE.

* **Representation**: The school does not always understand what matters for students while they always have the upper hand in defining our education: they have continuity, resources and long-term planning. However, we must use what we have: enthusiasm, competence and our army of volunteers (i.e. you). Therefore, I see as my most important job – if you elect me – to represent and stand up for the student interests 24/7.

I love challenges, and I am ready for this one!

Trust me – vote Amanda.
