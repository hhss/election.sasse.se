Hi peeps!

I love SSE and I believe that the education we acquire will be **vitally important for our future**. No matter if we want to make a career in banking, join a marketing agency, found our own company or become an elite hockey player.

However, I also do believe that our education can get even better and that this improvement is something all of us students at SSE can contribute to. Because who knows better than a master student how our master programs can be developed? And who knows how to improve our bachelor programs better than a bachelor student? But in order for us to really influence our courses contents and exams, someone has to actually **listen and act in reaction to our feedback**.

I want to continue **developing our ways of being heard** among the teachers and program directors. The earlier members of the Education Committee and my predecessors have already laid the perfect foundation through establishing focus groups and class representatives. These people can collect and present our suggestions for change in order to improve our education.

I will ensure that our suggestions are handled as something more important than mere thoughts and comments. Follow-up discussions, numbers of measuring the success of a course and presentations of substantial changes based on our suggestions are ways of **assuring real action**, whereof some are already initiated.

As the President of the Education Committee, I will put my creativity and earlier experiences from lecturing at high schools and being the Head of Events at Entrepreneurship Society to their maximum use. **Your opinions should not stagger as fierce discussions in the Atrium after an exam**. I want to, and I will, ensure that your voices get heard and that your suggestions will result in substantial improvements at SSE!

Thank you!
