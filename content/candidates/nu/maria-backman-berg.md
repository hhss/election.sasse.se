Being the president of the Business Committee would be a great honour for me.

If voted for President of the Business Committee (BC) my main goal would be to strengthen the bonds between the BC groups. For me it’s important that you don’t only feel like a member of one of our great projects or societies, but that you also feel like a valuable member of the BC. By interacting all project leaders and the board members, everyone will be able to influence the committee, learn from and help each other.

Being its leader, I will make the BC belong to its members.

Attracting new companies is always a vital goal for the BC, as well as for me. By listening to and work close with the students, we will be able to attract the companies that are truly desired by them. The work will focus on building high-quality, long-term relations with a few new, desired companies. As Head of New Company Relations of the BC board I have experiences in this area and I understand the importance of always doing a great job – towards the students as well as the companies.

Continuing the development of Career Services for all SASSE members is an important goal for me. The BC will arrange events where students are able to help and learn from each other regarding their future careers. This will not only be valuable for the students but also a way to open up the BC to everyone.

Last but not least, I will make sure that all fairs will do “run-ins” for Master Students and for the Retail Management Students. For me it is important that everyone feels invited to attend the great events arranged by the BC. Because more than ever, the BC will be open for everyone.
