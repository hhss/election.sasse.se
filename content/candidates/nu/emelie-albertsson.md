I am sure I am not the only one who feels that SASSE has enriched my life at SSE tremendously. On top of that, I have found I truly have a fire for the Business Committee and its people.

One purpose of the BC is to create a bridge between us students and our future careers. While achieving this I want to make sure all students are able to develop personal skills, get inspiration for career choices, and to make friends.

I believe it is of great importance to cooperate with a variety of firms to meet all students’ interests. By attracting more firms outside of the banking and consulting industries, the BC should also become a platform for entrepreneurial thought and creation.

After being in charge of the business presentations for a year, I see the importance of not only focusing on the BC itself, but also understanding how the organization works in relation to other actors, such as the school and all of SASSE. One area of improvement is the integration between Norrtälje and Sveavägen.

My dedication and willingness to truly put my heart into this responsibility makes me the right person to make sure we fulfill these goals together. I get extremely enthusiastic when thinking about what we can achieve together when combining all of our talents. I, therefore, ask for your support. Please, do not hesitate to ask me any questions you might have about my candidacy.
