Following my position in the SASSE board over the last year – I still have a lot to give in developing the strategic issues of SASSE. I can utilize my knowledge and understanding, combined with my passion for the association, to make its future even brighter.

A vote for me, is a vote for commitment and know-how, to make SASSE reach its full potential.
