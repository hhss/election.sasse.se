Title: Tilde Halvorsen

So, I thought I’d use Urban Dictionary’s explanation of Tilde (~):
“Basically it’s used in Spanish for some n:s, but not all n:s. It makes a sound like
the middle n in onion. This character does matter because of the difference in the
words anos (which means anus) and the word años (which means years).”

Conclusion: Tilde matters. Vote Tilde!
