SASSE is a great organization creating opportunities for its members with the Student Council being a vital part. Hence, I want to contribute my knowledge by being part of the Student Council where I would have the opportunity to further improve things, for us and future Handels students. As SSE is becoming more and more international I would like to stand in for the growing international student community, while promoting idea exchange in the Council.
