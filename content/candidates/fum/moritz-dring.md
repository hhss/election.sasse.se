The better integration of master students/opening SASSE up to this part of the Handels community would be my top priority as a member of the Student Council. Having obtained my bachelor’s degree abroad, I can compare SSE’s program with others and help to further improve it. As former head of Euromasters I will always hear the voice of the Sports committee.
