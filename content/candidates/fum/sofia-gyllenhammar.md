Having spent the last half-year as Coordination Officer at CFR I am now more than ready to represent all fellow students at SASSE in the Student Council.

Apart from working on the integration between Sveavägen/Norrtälje I have also been vice projectleader of SNS, head of events for Handels Traders and been writing for MiniMax… among many other projects.
