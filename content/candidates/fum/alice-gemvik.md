Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone. I hear you call my name and SASSE feels like home. When Council call my name it's like a little prayer. Sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree? I travel the school and the SSE’s. And I won't let you out of my sight. I'll be ready, I'll be ready.  Never you fear, no don't you fear.  I'll be ready, forever and always
