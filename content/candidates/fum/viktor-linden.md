When elected to the SC I will institute a framework for purchasing general project and event goods.

Today projects and events within SASSE are very separated when it comes to purchasing these sort of goods, my experience from the event business is that much can be gained by coordinating these purchases.

Vote for me and I will help your events and projects!
