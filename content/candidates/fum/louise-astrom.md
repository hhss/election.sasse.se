*SSE is a little better school.*

This was stated in the latest issue of our school magazine, and I truly believe this is much due to all the joy, inspiration and fellowship achieved through SASSE. As a first-year bachelor’s student with a huge crush on the student association, I’d love to represent you in order to make SASSE a little better than it already is!
