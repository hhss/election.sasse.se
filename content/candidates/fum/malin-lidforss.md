I am very grateful to be President of the Education Committee, and not being elected to the Student Council would be a great pity. Because my vital knowledge in working with faculty and student, would make my opinion in the Student Council very prudent. Never forget that voting is our given right, in showing the SASSE membersâ€™ might.
