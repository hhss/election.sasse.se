I have dedicated a lot of my time to the wonderful thing that is the Student Association. This experience and knowledge would be of great use in the Student Council. I will work for a fair and efficient council that will benefit all students at the school. I will work to increase the knowledge of the council among students. No more what happens in FUM stays in FUM.
