I have big plans for the Media Committee. To put it in simple words – I want the Media Committee to be more like the Batman. Yeah, that’s right. The Batman. Sounds confusing? Give me a minute and I’ll explain.

I have come to love everything about the Media Committee. My only concern is that few others feel the same way. I want to change this. As President of the Media Committee there are three key issues I will prioritize in order to make the Media Committee the most popular committee of SASSE.

First of all, I want the Media Committee to be more powerful. So, what do I mean by this? Well, more students engaged in all the creative projects we offer at the Media Committee of course.  However, to simply put more students within the existing projects is not the most efficient way. My solution will be to launch more projects.

Second, I want the Media Committee to be richer. To me, more money equals more spending. Electing me as President, the Media Committee will see an upgrade of all the cameras, flashes and speakers needed to keep producing high-quality productions.

Finally, I want to make SASSE more skillful in both the internal and external communication. This will be done by educating the students in the same manner as the Fokus photo classes so successfully have done this year. I am positive more students at SSE want to learn how to make a movie, design a logo or draw a cartoon.

So, I thought about this for quite some time and I asked myself, who has the power, the money and the skills to get things done? Only one simple answer came to my mind – The Batman.

So folks, there you have it. Keep calm and vote Batman.
