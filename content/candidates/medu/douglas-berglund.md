Recently, I walked into the Media Committee room. It was late at night, but the place was all but dead. In one corner there were two guys discussing their new radio show. In another, a girl was drawing the layout for the next MiniMax. All the computers were taken, at which people were editing movies and photos, the speakers flooded the room with music and in the middle of the creative chaos, studio lamps flashed as this evening’s photo session was in progress.

For the first time ever, I saw MedU reaching for its full potential. MedU shouldn’t be the place where the communication guide is the center of attention and the only e-mails you get is a reminder of that it is your turn to clean this week. MedU is a full scale production site and should be treated that way. Why sit here and dream of starting a production company, when it literally is right down the street?

If I am elected President of the Media Committee, I will:

* Make sure that MedU is a place of production rather than restrictions.
* Make it easy and accessible to participate in any production we do.
* Turn MedU into a stand-by studio.

This year, Radio Kaos has resurrected, MiniMax is the best ever, Fokus could probably claim every profile picture in Facebook as their work, and people buy popcorn to lectures in hope of a new inspringsfilm made by HandelsTV. Therefore, I think that this is the time to do something radical.

Let’s make it happen.

**Vote Douglas for President of the Media Committee.**
