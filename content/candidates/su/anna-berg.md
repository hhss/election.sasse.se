So far, I have had an absolutely fantastic time at SSE and the reason is without a doubt SASSE! During my first year, I’ve been involved in a wide range of activities, from head of event at M2 to being the vice president of the Social Committee. I’ve also had great fun as a marshal in the Entertainment Committee and been privileged to welcome 300 new Småttings as Big Mama. After these experiences, I now wish to take my involvement one step further and spend the next year as President of the Social Committee.

To me, the Social Committee is a great place to develop one’s interests within the Student Association, with members being able to do anything from simply playing a board game during the lunch break, to taking on responsibility for the entire Culture Week. Whether arranging a wine tasting or just spreading the joy of one’s passion or hobby by becoming a Guru, the openness and welcoming atmosphere of SU is one of the things I admire the most.

It is my ambition to continue to develop these many cultural and social activities, while also emphasizing the more strategic questions that are part of SU’s responsibility. It will be a great challenge to coordinate the changes regarding all three introductions as well as ensuring that student health and CSN issues are not forgotten. These are some of the tasks that I am very passionate about handling during my year in the SASSE board.

I would like to take the step from vice president to president. Please vote for me for the Social Committee.
