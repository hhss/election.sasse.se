SASSE is a beautiful organization that has united SSE-students for over a century. It would be an honor to lead the Entertainment Committee, the oldest committee of SASSE, which works around the clock to make sure that we have the time of our lives together.

Within SASSE I have, apart from being an EC-marshal, been head of the Småttingspex, project manager of Enterprise Day and project group member of Exchange Japan. I am currently vice president of the Business Committee and believe that a broad experience from the association is key to understanding the role of the EC in organizing events for all parts of SASSE, and beneficial when representing you in the SASSE board.

If given your trust as next president of the EC I will focus on improving the way you experience all SASSE festivities; from you not waiting in the cold outside Kopparporten to how you’re served in the bar and able to dance the night away in a Rotunda that doesn’t drown you in your own sweat. My aim is for you to be surprised every time you come to an EC-event by mind-blowing theme decorations, enthusiastic marshals and skilled entertainment from the DJ-booth as well as on stage. I will strive to create further interaction and fellowship between the bachelor programs of Sveavägen and Norrtälje as well as the master students; together we have even more fun!

Give me your vote and you’re one step closer to a year that will give you amazing memories for a lifetime (though you might not remember them all…). I will be a Klubbis with the ability to gather the right team to bring SASSE festivities to the next level, a SASSE board member who understands the other committees, and I will do everything to develop our fantastic association.
