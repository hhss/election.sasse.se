## What would you give to the Hecklers in order to make them behave nicely?
Something (a lot) from the kulvert, preferably before my heckling…

## Three reasons to vote for you:
* I love SASSE and EC and will do my very best to make us evolve and grow
* If you would think that Vårbal > vårpub
* I’m probably the best DJ this school has ever seen (according to myself)

## Three reasons not to vote for you:
* I can be a time optimist
* If not patient enough to stand in line during a pub, I pee in the playground. Sorry kids!
* I’m probably the worst DJ this school has ever seen (according to the rest of you)

## What do you do on a Sunday?
If I’m lucky; Dancing on the table, throwing some cucumbers and wearing a silly hat. See where I’m heading...?  (Zilliz of course)

"Alice in Wonderland, novel; - tells of a girl named Alice and her adventures in a fantasy world (Wonderland) that plays with logic."

The wonderful world we are lucky to have in our basement is really something, I want to keep it a wonderland. Magical nights bring adventures that plays with logic and that you might not understand, nor remember. However, these adventures do somehow create a fantastic collection of memories from the years at SSE.

The last year has been the best year of my life, and this is with great thanks to SASSE; all its activities and members. It would be an honour to lead the Entertainment Committee and to be a part of the SASSE board. This would give me one year to carry on the ancient traditions of the oldest committee, as well as embracing and developing new ones. It would also allow me to get a deeper insight in and work with all parts of SASSE.

During my time here I’ve been involved in many different projects; M2, Handelsdagarna, Småttingspex, Ski Committee and EC. I’m understanding, quirky and always appreciate a good laugh (even though I’m sometimes the subject of laughter…). These qualities and engagements have given me experiences that I will have great use of in such an honourable position.

The Entertainment Committee is not only responsible for arranging the best parties within miles but also to help and support when other committees arrange parties. As a president of EC, my aspiration is to always be available for questions and guidance. My wish is to improve some aspects of our work; better queue-system, quicker bar-service and to take away some of the workload from other committee board members by arranging some parties in their place, which I hope will also increase cooperation between EC and other committees.

I would also dedicate the year to make sure changes such as refurbishments of the pub are actualized, keep on creating memories that the students will have long after leaving the dirty still delightful Rotunda and finally to preserve and, if possible, prosper the unique spirit among the students. I’m passionate and ready to take on SASSE in a new way.

Give me a shot, or two, and vote for me as Klubbis!
