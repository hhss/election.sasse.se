        If you've paid your SASSE fee, you should have received an e-mail to your
        SSE student e-mail address with a unique link to the voting site. Follow
        the link to vote for your candidates. Voting is open until 17:00, 6th of December.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Due to technical problems, the initial send-out was duplicated.
        Because of this, we've had to restart voting. <strong>Please only vote using the link
        in the last e-mail you've got.</strong>

      <p>The results will be presented during the Election Pub in the Rotunda at 8 p.m. Thursday the 6th of December.</p>
